# CMPE202 Lab 8
Alan Hsueh

This is my submission for lab 8. The design pattern I used in this lab was the "decorator."
Due to the fact that there was slight string manipulation that was required to be performed on both the Credit Card Number and the Expiration Date, respective decorators were created for both.

NumDecorator.java
