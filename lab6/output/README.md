# CMPE202 Lab 6
Alan Hsueh

The design pattern used in the lab was the composite design pattern. Using the same concept as Lab 2, it was possible to customize an entire burger with individual toppings (marked by their position within the burger in respect to patty) and run the printDescription() method on each topping. Simply put, the print function could be uniformly called on both the entire custom burger, as well as individual fry orders.
