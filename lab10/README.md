# CMPE202 Lab 10
Alan Hsueh

This is my submission for lab 10. 

Major differences in the implementation for the FeatureIDE/AspectJ version of this lab and the original Java version include the capability of switching gumball machine configurations in a config file. This is different from the original implementation that I made, which required instantiating multiple gumball machine objects. Overall, the FeatureIDE/AspectJ version is much more user friendly, and reusable as well.
